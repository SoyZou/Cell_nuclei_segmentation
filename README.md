# Cell nuclei segmentation
Image segmentation is basically the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share the same characteristics.

The objective of this project is to automatically segment any medical image containing cell nuclei by assigning a value of 1 to the cell nuclei and 0 to the rest. For this purpose, a deep learning model will be trained with a large number of medical images containing cell nuclei.
